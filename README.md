# Multilabel_article_extraction
      We will train a multi-label convolutional neural network text classifier on our Article Categories, using spaCy's new TextCategorizer component.

SpaCy provides classification model with multiple, non-mutually exclusive labels. You can change the model architecture rather easily, but by default, the TextCategorizer class uses a convolutional neural network to assign position-sensitive vectors to each word in the document. The TextCategorizer uses its own CNN model, to avoid sharing weights with the other pipeline components. The document tensor is then summarized by concatenating max and mean pooling, and a multilayer perceptron is used to predict an output vector of length nr_class, before a logistic activation is applied elementwise. The value of each output neuron is the probability that some class is present.
